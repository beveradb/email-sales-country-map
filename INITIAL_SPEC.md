Based on the transcript, I've identified the core requirements for your app. It's a data visualization tool that authenticates with Google, reads specific emails from the user's Gmail, aggregates data, and displays it on an interactive world map.

Here is a comprehensive plan to build this application as a static site with a backend powered by Cloudflare Workers.

### **Project Overview: "Sales Mapper"**

The application will be a Single Page Application (SPA). The "static site" part (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) will be served by Cloudflare Pages, and the dynamic backend logic (Google OAuth, Gmail API interaction) will be handled by a Cloudflare Worker.

### **Technology Stack**

* **Frontend:**
    * **Framework:** React (using Vite for a fast, modern build setup).
    * **Mapping Library:** `react-simple-maps` or Leaflet. `react-simple-maps` is excellent for creating geographic visualizations like choropleth maps with D3.js under the hood, without the steep learning curve of D3.
    * **Styling:** CSS Modules or a framework like Tailwind CSS.
* **Backend:**
    * **Platform:** Cloudflare Workers.
    * **Storage (for caching):** Cloudflare KV (Key-Value store).
* **Authentication:** Google OAuth 2.0.
* **Deployment:**
    * Cloudflare Pages for the static frontend.
    * Wrangler CLI for deploying the Cloudflare Worker.

### **High-Level Architecture**

1.  **User visits the site** (hosted on Cloudflare Pages).
2.  **User clicks "Login with Google"**. The frontend redirects them to a backend endpoint on the Cloudflare Worker.
3.  **The Worker** redirects the user to the Google OAuth consent screen, requesting `gmail.readonly` scope.
4.  **User grants permission**. Google redirects back to a callback endpoint on the Worker with an authorization code.
5.  **The Worker** exchanges the code for an `access_token` and a `refresh_token` from Google. It securely stores the `refresh_token` (e.g., encrypted in a database or as a secure, `HttpOnly` cookie) and establishes a session for the user.
6.  **The frontend** is now authenticated. It makes a request to the Worker (e.g., `/api/sales-data`).
7.  **The Worker**, using the user's `access_token`, queries the Gmail API.
8.  **The Worker** processes the emails, aggregates the country data, and returns a simple JSON object to the frontend (e.g., `{"United States": 150, "Finland": 25, "Brazil": 10}`).
9.  **The frontend** uses this JSON data to render the interactive map and statistics.

### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Authentication Backend**

This phase focuses on getting the core authentication flow working with Cloudflare Workers.

**Task 1.1: Environment Setup**
* Create a Cloudflare account.
* Create a Google Cloud Platform project to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials (Client ID and Client Secret).
    * In the GCP console, configure the OAuth consent screen.
    * Specify the authorized JavaScript origins (your development and production URLs).
    * Specify the authorized redirect URIs. This will point to your Cloudflare Worker's callback endpoint (e.g., `https://<your-worker>.<your-domain>.workers.dev/api/auth/callback`).
* Install Node.js and the Cloudflare `wrangler` CLI: `npm install -g wrangler`.

**Task 1.2: Cloudflare Worker for Authentication**
* Initialize a new Worker project: `wrangler init sales-mapper-worker`.
* Store your Google Client ID and Client Secret as secrets in the Worker, **not** in the code:
    * `wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
    * `wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
* Create two API endpoints in your worker:
    * `GET /api/auth/login`: This endpoint constructs the Google OAuth URL with the correct scopes (`gmail.readonly`) and redirects the user to it.
    * `GET /api/auth/callback`: This is the redirect URI you configured in GCP. It will:
        1.  Receive the `code` from Google in the query parameters.
        2.  Make a POST request to Google's token endpoint to exchange the `code` for an `access_token` and `refresh_token`.
        3.  Securely handle the tokens (e.g., setting a signed, `HttpOnly` cookie containing the access token).
        4.  Redirect the user back to the main frontend application page.

### **Phase 2: Data Processing Backend & Frontend Scaffolding**

This phase involves fetching and processing the Gmail data in the worker and setting up the basic frontend app.

**Task 2.1: Gmail Data Fetching in the Worker**
* Create a new protected endpoint: `GET /api/sales-data`. This endpoint will first verify the user's session (e.g., from the cookie).
* **Step 1: Search for Emails:** Use the Gmail API to search for emails matching the criteria:
    * Query: `from:clips4sale subject:"You've made a sale"`
* **Step 2: Handle Pagination:** The Gmail API returns a list of message IDs, potentially across multiple pages. Your code must loop through all pages to get a complete list of matching emails.
* **Step 3: Fetch Email Content in Batches:** To be efficient, use the Gmail API's batch endpoint to retrieve the full content of multiple emails (e.g., 100 at a time) in a single HTTP request. Request the `payload` of each message.
* **Step 4: Parse and Aggregate:**
    * For each email's content, look for the text `Country from IP:`.
    * Use a regular expression or simple string manipulation to extract the country name from that line. Be sure to handle potential variations in whitespace.
    * Maintain a JavaScript `Map` or `Object` to store the counts: `{'countryName': count}`.
    * Increment the count for each country found.
* **Step 5: Return Data:** Respond with the aggregated data as a JSON object.

**Task 2.2: Basic Frontend Setup**
* Initialize a new React project using Vite: `npm create vite@latest sales-mapper-ui -- --template react-ts`.
* Create the basic UI structure:
    * A `LoginPage` component with a single "Login with Google" button that links to `/api/auth/login`.
    * A `DashboardPage` component that will house the map and stats. This page should be shown only after login.
    * Implement basic routing (e.g., using `react-router-dom`).

### **Phase 3: Frontend Visualization and Interactivity**

This is where you bring the data to life.

**Task 3.1: Data Fetching and State Management**
* In the `DashboardPage`, use a `useEffect` hook to call your `/api/sales-data` backend endpoint when the component mounts.
* Manage the application state with `useState` hooks:
    * `loading`: A boolean to show a spinner while data is being fetched.
    * `error`: To display an error message if the API call fails.
    * `salesData`: To store the `{ country: count }` object from the API.

**Task 3.2: Map Implementation (`react-simple-maps`)**
* Install the library: `npm install react-simple-maps`.
* Create a `WorldMap` component that receives `salesData` as a prop.
* Inside the component, use the `<ComposableMap>`, `<Geographies>`, and `<Geography>` components to render a world map.
* Map the `salesData` to the visuals:
    * Iterate through the geographies provided by the map.
    * For each geography (country), check if its name exists in your `salesData`.
    * **Choropleth (Color):** If data exists, calculate a color based on the sale count. Use a color scale (e.g., light green for low counts, dark green for high counts). Set this in the `fill` style of the `<Geography>` component.
    * **Dots:** Alternatively, render a `<Marker>` component on the centroid of each country with sales. The size of the marker (`<circle>`) can be proportional to the sales count.
* Add tooltips on hover to show the country name and exact sales count.

**Task 3.3: Controls and Statistics**
* Create a `Controls` component with toggles to switch between the visualization modes (choropleth color vs. dot size).
* Create a `Stats` component that displays:
    * **Leaderboards:** "Top 5 Countries" and "Bottom 5 Countries". You can calculate this by sorting the `salesData` object.
    * **Key Metrics:** "Country with Most Sales", "Country with Least Sales", "Total Countries with Sales".

### **Phase 4: Deployment & Refinements**

**Task 4.1: Deployment**
* Configure your React app's build process to proxy API requests to your local worker during development to avoid CORS issues. (Vite has a `server.proxy` option for this).
* Deploy the worker using `wrangler deploy`.
* Connect your GitHub repository for the React app to Cloudflare Pages for continuous deployment.
* Set the production environment variables (secrets) in the Cloudflare dashboard for your worker.

**Task 4.2: Caching and Performance**
* The Gmail scan can be slow if the user has thousands of emails. To improve user experience:
    * **User Feedback:** On the frontend, show a more detailed loading status (e.g., "Scanned 500 of 2500 emails...").
    * **Backend Caching:** In the worker, after a successful scan, store the result in Cloudflare KV with a time-to-live (TTL), e.g., 1 hour. `KV.put('user-id:sales-data', data, { expirationTtl: 3600 })`. On subsequent requests, check the cache first. Add a "Force Refresh" button on the frontend to bypass the cache.

**Task 4.3: Error Handling and Edge Cases**
* Improve error handling for when the Google API token expires. The worker should use the `refresh_token` to get a new `access_token`.
* Handle cases where the email format from "clips4sale" might change, preventing country data from being parsed. Log these errors.
* Ensure the UI gracefully handles a user revoking Google permissions.
